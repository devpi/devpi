Creating a user, an index and uploading to it
--------------------------------------------------------

The default access control of a devpi-server instance allows 
users to register themselves and create and work
with their user-specific indexes freely.  

create bob as a new user::

    $ devpi user -c bob email=bob@email.com  # email is required
    enter password for bob : ***********
    repeat password for bob: ***********
    -> user "bob" created, with email bob@email.com

login as bob::

    $ devpi login bob
    enter password for bob : ***********
    -> user "bob" logged in, credentials stored (valid for 10 hours)

create a "bob/dev" index and directly set it as your "current" index::

    $ devpi index -c --use dev
    -> volatile index "bob/dev" created
    -> upstreams: int/prod, ext/pypi
    -> using index "bob/dev" as current index

upload a package to your current "bob/dev" index:

    $ devpi upload

.. note::

    Due to the ``volatile=True`` default of the ``indexadd`` command,
    the upload action can overwrite versions.
