devpi-2.1 (metapackage)
---------------------------------

devpi-server-2.1.0 (compared to 2.0.6):

- make replication more precise: if a file cannot be replicated,
  fail with an error log and try again in a few seconds.
  This helps to maintain a consistent replica and discover 
  the potential remaining bugs in the replication code.

- add who/when metadata to release files, doczips and test results
  and preserve it during push operations so that any such file provides
  some history which can be visualized via the web-plugin.  The metadata
  is also exposed via the json API (/USER/INDEX/PROJECTNAME[/VERSION])

- fix issue113: provide json status information at /+status including roles 
  and replica polling status, UUIDs of the repository. See new
  server status docs for more info.

- support for external authentication plugins: new devpiserver_auth_user 
  hook which plugins can implement for user/password validation and
  for providing group membership.

- support groups for acl_upload via the ":GROUPNAME" syntax. This
  requires an external authentication plugin that provides group
  information.

- on replicas return auth status for "+api" requests 
  by relaying to the master instead of using own key.

- add "--restrict-modify" option to specify users/groups which can create,
  delete and modify users and indices.

- make master/replica configuration more permanent and a bit safer
  against accidental errors: introduce "--role=auto" option, defaulting
  to determine the role from a previous invocation or the presence of the
  "--master-url" option if there was no previous invocation.  Also verify
  that a replica talks to the same master UUID as with previous requests.

- replaced hack from nginx template which abused "try_files" in "location /"
  with the recommended "error_page"/"return" combo.
  Thanks Jürgen Hermann

- change command line option "--master" to "--master-url"

- fix issue97: remove already deprecated --upgrade 
  option in favor of just using --export/--import

- actually store UTC in last_modified attribute of release files instead of
  the local time disguising as UTC.  preserve last_modified when pushing 
  a release.  

- fix exception when a static resource can't be found.

- address issue152: return a proper 400 "not registered" message instead
  of 500 when a doczip is uploaded without prior registration.

- add OSX/launchd example configuration when "--gen-config" is issued.
  thanks Sean Fisk.

- fix replica proxying: don't pass original host header when relaying a
  modifying request from replica to master.

- fix export error when a private project doesnt exist on pypi

- fix pushing of a release when it contains multiple tox results.

- fix "refresh" button on simple pages on replica sites

- fix an internal link code issue possibly affecting strangeness
  or exceptions with test result links

- be more tolerant when different indexes have different project names 
  all mapping to the same canonical project name.

- fix issue161: allow "{pkgversion}" to be part of a jenkins url


devpi-web-2.2.0 (compared to 2.1.6):

- require devpi-server >= 2.1.0

- static resources now have a plus in front to avoid clashes with usernames and
  be consistent with how other urls work: "+static/..." and "+theme-static/..."

- adjusted font-sizes and cut-off width of content.

- only show underline on links when hovering.

- make the "description hasn't been rendered" warning stand out.

- version.pt: moved md5 sum from it's own column to the file column below the
  download link

- version.pt: added "history" column showing last modified time and infos
  about uploads and pushes.

- fix issue153: friendly error messages on upstream errors.

- index.pt: show permissions on index page

devpi-client-2.0.3 (compared to 2.0.2)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- use default "https://www.python.org/pypi" when no repository is set in .pypirc
  see https://docs.python.org/2/distutils/packageindex.html#the-pypirc-file

- fix issue152: when --upload-docs is given, make sure to first register
  and upload the release file before attempting to upload docs (the latter
  requires prior registration)

- fix issue75: add info about basic auth to "url" option help of "devpi use".

- fix issue154: fix handling of vcs-exporting when unicode filenames are
  present.  This is done by striking our own code in favor of Marius Gedminas' 
  vcs exporting functions from his check-manifest project which devpi-client
  now depends on.  This also adds in support for svn and bazaar in addition
  to the already supported git/hg.

- devpi list: if a tox result does not contain basic information (probably a bug in
  tox) show a red error instead of crashing out with a traceback.

- fix issue157: filtering of tox results started with the oldest ones and
  didn't show newer results if the host, platform and environment were the same.

   

devpi-2.0.2 (metapackage)
---------------------------------

devpi-server-2.0.5 (compared to 2.0.2):
   
- fix issue145: restrict devpi_common dependency so that a future
  "pip install 'devpi-server<2.0'" has a higher chance of working.

- fix issue144: fix interaction with requests-2.4.0 -- 
  use new devpi-common-offered "Errors" enumeration to check for exceptions.

- add '*' as possible option for pypi_whitelist to whitelist all packages of
  an index at once. Refs issue110

- outside url now works with paths, so you can host a devpi server on something
  like http://example.com/foo/

- fix issue84: during upload: if a previously registered name diverges from a freshly
  submitted one take the previously registered one.  This can happen when uploading
  wheels and in other situations.

- fix issue132: during exporting use whatever name comes with the
  versiondata instead of trying too hard to assert consistency of different
  versions.

- fix issue130: fix deletion of users so that is properly deletes all
  indexes and projects and files on each index.

- fix issue139: adapt to a recent change in pypi which now serves
  under URLs using normalized project names instead of the "real" registered name
  Thanks Timothy Allen and others for sorting this out.
  
- fix issue129: fix __init__ provided version and add a test that it always matches
  the one which pkg_resources sees (which gets it effectively from setup.py)

- fix issue128: a basic auth challenge needs to be sent back on submit when no
  authorization headers are sent with the post request.

devpi-client-2.0.2 (compared to 2.0.1):

- fix issue135: fix port mismatch for basic auth if port isn't explicitly given
  on https urls.

- refs issue75: pass on basic auth info into pip.cfg and co.

- fix issue144: fix interaction with requests-2.4 by depending
  on devpi-common's new support for enumerating possible Errors

- keep basic authentication info when listing indices or switching index by
  using path only instead of full URL.
  Thanks Trevor Joynson

- only write new client config if it actually changed and pretty print it.
  Thanks Jürgen Hermann for initial PR and ideas.


devpi-2.0.1 (metapackage)
---------------------------------

devpi-server-2.0.2:
   
- fix issue120: link to "upgrade" section from main index page.

- preserve http reason string for setup.py submit through replica proxying

- proper error message when "devpi push X" uses an X that comes from 
  a base index or is not existent

- fix issue121: depend on py-1.4.23 to fix python3.4 compatibility
  for a venusian/py34/py interaction import oddity.

- fix issue126: handle deletion of pypi project cache entries correctly 
  (i.e. ones that are triggered by "refresh" on simple page).

- Add special handling of ":ANONYMOUS:" user in acl_upload to allow anonymous
  submit.

- fix nginx template so that when used in a replica setting the master
  always answers HEAD requests without nginx short-cirtcuiting it.

- increase internal cache size to improve performance when many indexes
  and projects are served.

devpi-web-2.0.1:

- fix issue125: javascript for embedded doc view didn't work correctly.

- fix issue118: rendering of description with unicode.

devpi-client-2.0.1:
 
- fix a test to expect a 403 instead of a 401 from devpi server from
  unauthorized access 

- fix error message on API version client/server mismatch

- fix issue124: package name url matching for the "devpi test" command


2.0.0
--------------

devpi-server:

- major revamp of the internal core of devpi to support
  replication (both master and server code), a plugin architecture
  with the new devpi-web plugin providing a new web interface.
  Mostly done by Florian Schulze and Holger Krekel.

- moved all html views except for files and the simple index to new
  devpi-web package. Thanks to Florian Schulze for the PR.

- implement issue103: By default if you register a package in an index,
  no lookup on pypi is made for that package anymore. You have to add the
  package to the pypi_whitelist of the index to let pypi releases be mixed in.
  This is to prevent malicious uploads on pypi to overwrite private packages.

- change json api to get rid of the different meaning of URLs with and
  without a trailing slash. "/{user}/" is now the same as "/user" and always
  lists indices.  "/{user}/{index}" and "/{user}/{index}/ now always
  lists the index config and the contained per-stage projects
  (not inherited ones).

- switch the wsgi app to use Pyramid and waitress for WSGI serving.

- don't refresh releaselinks from the mirroring thread but rather
  rely on the next access to do it.

- fix issue98: deleting a project config or a project version now accepts
  names which map to the canonical name of a project.

- fix issue82 and fix issue81: root/pypi now provides the same
  attributes as normal indexes and results in a 409 MethodNotAllowed
  http code when trying to change the config.

- fix issue91: make serverport available as well. Thanks David Bonner.

- fix issue100: support large file uploads.  As we switched away from 
  bottle to pyramid, the body-size limit is gone.

- fix issue99: make "devpi-server --start" etc work when devpi-server
  is not itself on PATH (by using sys.argv[0] for finding the binary)

- fix issue84: uploading of wheels where the registered package name 
  has an underscore works despite a wheel's metadata carrying
  hyphens instead.  At submit-file time we now lookup the registered
  name and use that instead of assuming the one coming with the wheel
  is the correct one.

- add refresh button on root/pypi project simple index pages which clears the
  internal cache to force a refetch from PyPI.

- implement issue75: We use the custom X-Devpi-Auth header for authentication
  now, instead of overwriting the Authentication header.

- added experimental support for using client certificates when running as a
  replica of a server running behind a proxy

devpi-client:

- Compatibility with devpi-server >= 2.0.0

- introduce "patchjson PATH JSONFILE" command which allows to send
  a request containing a json data structure to a specified path 

- fix issue85: "devpi list -v" now shows package names with latest
  versions.

- implement issue75: We use the custom X-Devpi-Auth header for authentication
  now, instead of overwriting the Authentication header.

- added experimental support for basic authentication by parsing user and
  password from the url given to the "devpi use" command.

- issue74: added experimental support for client side certificates via
  "devpi use --client-cert"

devpi-web:

- initial release



1.2.2
----------------------------

devpi-server:

- fix issue78: create less directories for pypi package files by
  splitting the md5 part into two. Avoids TooManyLinks errors in
  large installations.

- fix --stop on windows.  Thanks to Christian Ullrich for the PR.

- fix issue79: interoperate with pip-1.5 by interpreting accept
  header as "*/*" as html_preferred.  Thanks Richard Jones.

- use latest virtualenv-1.11.2 when bootstrapping on jenkins

- fix issue89: adapt for bottle changes in 0.12.1.  Thanks 
  Alexey Sveshnikov.

devpi-client:

- depend on pkginfo>1.2b1 for wheel metadata reading support, 
  remove twine dependency. Thanks Tres Seaver.

- new: also write buildout configuration file with --set-cfg.
  Thanks Christian Ullrich for the PR.


1.2.1
----------------------------

devpi-server:

- fix an import issue for doc files which were wrongly tied to a newer
  version of a base index. now version "auto" detection for storing
  doc files only works within a stage.  Thanks Laurent Brack for bringing
  it up and providing the repo.

- fix issue66: api endpoints now also respect --outside-url setting
  so that you can serve devpi from a subpath.  Thanks for Fabian
  Snovna for reporting and analysis.

- fix issue63: skip egg links that go to a directory (this requires
  doing a SVN checkout which devpi-server does not do).  Thanks
  Ken Jung for analyzing the problem.

- fix issue68: don't derive metadata from filename but instead
  look it up in metadata or submitted form.

- fix cache-invalidation when normalized_project_name != real_name
  (e.g. for Django but also many others). addresses issue59.

- add newline to simple list output for better human readability of the
  page (thanks Brandon Maister)

- make xmlrpc calls to pypi's changelog API use "requests" sessions 
  so that http proxies are respected there as well (fixes issue58).
  thanks to riehlm for identifying the problem and testing the fix.

- internally refactor and consolidate mocking against requests library

- --upgrade-state will upgrade now between major.minor/major.minor+1 changes.

devpi-client:

- fix "python -m devpi" invocation. Thanks Sebastian Ralph.

- fix issue66: "devpi use user/index" can now switch between URLs
  if user/index is mounted on a subpath.

- fix issue71: allow pip/setuptools like requirements specs
  with the test subcommand, e.g.  "devpi test 'pkg>=1.0'".
  Thanks Sebastian Rahlf for the PR.


1.2
----------------------------

devpi-server:

- serve links to files on simple pages and index root as relative
  paths so that it works more nicely with proxy-pass server setups.
  fixes issue56.

- make devpi-server and devpi-common python3.3 compatible, addresses
  issue57

- use system http/s proxy settings from devpi-server.  fixes issue58.

- refactor locations to allow nginx serving static files more directly.
  Also updated nginx template accordingly.

- rework "--upgrade-state" to detect the state version of the server dir
  and create an appropriate virtualenv with a devpi-server install in order
  to export data, and then import that version.

- allow to use /user/index as indexserver url for pip/easy_install by
  redirecting non-json queries to /user/index/PROJ[/] to 
  /user/index/+simple/PROJ/

- fix submission of multi-value fields like "classifiers" or "platform"
  (previously they would be wrongly collapsed to become the last value of a list)

- fix normalization import/export issue: pypi names take precendence
  for defining the "real" name of a project.

- always store uploaded documentation with a version.  While 
  "devpi upload" will make sure to pass in the version, "setup.py upload_docs"
  will not pass in a version.  In the latter case, devpi-server assumes
  the documentation belongs to the highest yet registered release.
  This change requires exporting with devpi-1.1 and importing with devpi-1.2
  in order to properly store versioned docs internally.

- use types/url/metadata/validation functionality of new depdency devpi_common 

- internal cleanup using pytest-flakes

- make devpi-server use a proper UserAgent string

devpi-client:

- "devpi list" and "devpi remove" now accept a pip/setuptools style
  requirement like "pkg>=1.0" instead of the former for limited "pkg-1.0".

- make devpi-client fully work with python3.3 and fix test bugs 

- use system http/s proxy settings.  fixes issue58.

- add "devpi test -c tox.ini package" to use a particular (external)
  tox.ini for running tox with the unpackaged package.
  also add "--fallback-ini tox.ini" option which will only 
  be used if the download package has no tox.ini.

- new "devpi use --set-cfg" option to set pip/easy_install configuration
  files when changing indexes.  Also new "devpi use --always-set-cfg=yes"
  option if you want to imply "--set-cfg" on future "devpi use" invocations
  and "devpi use --always-st-cfg=no" to disable this implication.

- support git and hg for exporting all versioned files of a directory 
  before performing the build step when uploading

- improve how upload works: setup.py is only used for building docs
  and release files but not for the remote upload part.  This gets rid of a 
  number of hacks that were done trying to get the Python shipped "distutils" 
  to pick the proper devpi index and allows proper SSL verification on Python2.6
  onwards.

- upload: show response when uploading documentation failed

- upload: allow to specify archive files as positional arguments (both files and
  directories can be specified but the latter additionally require
  a --upload-dirs option)

- fix issue54: upload now works on wheel files as well.
  As pkginfo does not support wheels directly, we use the ``twine``
  project which extends pkginfo for now.

- only show highest version in "devpi list PROJECT" output, unless
  "--all" is specified.

- on upload release files: skip rather than guess packages which contain no metadata

- strike BeautifulSoup dependency and re-use vendored pip-link parser

- use types/url/metadata/validation functionality of new depdency devpi_common 

- internal cleanup wrt pytest-flakes discoveries

- remove "archive" dependency in favour of a small implementation in
  devpi_common

- make devpi-client use a proper UserAgent string


1.1
----------------------------

devpi-server:

- systematically test pypi/mirror code against all 34K pypi projects
  so that we know that all http/https installable archive links that pypi offers 
  are correctly recognized by devpi-server's root/pypi index.

- if no pypi mirror state is known, devpi-server now calls
  pypi to obtain names/serials.  It will fail to start
  if no such initial connection is possible.  Once a first mirror
  state is known, subsequent devpi-server starts will
  not perform this initial query.

- speed up and make more reliable all operations on private packages which
  have no pypi.python.org release: we can now determine if a project
  exists on pypi and under which name exactly without
  remote queries or redirects to pypi.python.org.

- fix issue45: register/upload package names are now properly 
  validated and redirects take place if e.g. a project was
  registered as "name-sub" and "+simple/name_sub" is queried.

- new --upgrade-state command to allow for easy and safe
  in-place upgrading of server state.  This is not guranteed
  to be possible for all future releases which might require
  using --export with an older version and --import with a newer
  version.

- new --export/--import options to dump and import server contents:
  users, indexes, docs, release files and (test) attachments.
  Note that root/pypi (PyPI-caching information) will not be exported/imported.
  (maybe in the future if there is demand). 

- fix issue49: both push and import/export now support docfiles.  Note,
  however, that docfiles relate to a project as a whole and are not tied
  to a particular version.  This property is inherited from the PyPI
  standard upload_docs action and cannot be changed without interfering
  or replacing the upload_docs protocol of setuptools/sphinx.

- fix issue51: return 200 code if release file is successfully uploaded 
  but jenkins could not be triggered (previously returned 500)

- reject simple/NAME if NAME contains non-ascii characters
  (PEP426 naming rules)

- devpi-server now returns a X-DEVPI-API-VERSION and
  X-DEVPI-SERVER-VERSION header.  For future incompatible changes 
  these versions allow clients to reject interactions.

- also add ".serverversion" file and write it if it does not
  exist, and make devpi-server use it to verify if
  operating on a compatible server data layout, otherwise bail out.

- address issue43: --gendeploy now uses pip without --pre and
  explicitely instructs pip to install the exact same version 
  of devpi-server with which --gendeploy is issued.

- fix issue46 -- for GET /root/pypi/ only show a link to the
  simple page instead of computing "latest in-stage packages"
  which is only useful for devpi's user indices.

- fix issue37: upload with expired login causes proper 401


devpi-client:

- detect "X-DEVPI-API-VERSION" header and check for compatibility.
  devpi-client currently supports version "1" and warns if
  no version is known (defaulting to "1").

- getjson now prints http reply headers if "-v|--verbose" was supplied.

- fix issue52: add "--no-vcs" option to force "devpi upload" to not
  vcs-export files before executing build/upload

- fix issue50: introduce "--toxargs" to "devpi test" invocations in
  order to add arbitrary arguments to tox.

- fix issue43: set PIP_PRE environment variable when executing
  "devpi install ..." so that the behaviour between 
  pip < 1.4 and >= 1.4 is normalized to always install 
  development versions.

- fix issue47: set PIP_USE_WHEEL with "devpi install ..." so that
  it will automatically pick up wheel files if pip>1.4 is used.

- fix issue42: allow to set empty bases for an index, so that it doesn't
  inherit anything.

- fix issue44: "use -l" doesn't break when a user has no index

- devpi test now invokes tox in-process (by importing tox) rather than
  a subprocess.


1.0
----------------------------

devpi-server:

- rename "--datadir" to "--serverdir" to better match
  the also picked up DEVPI_SERVERDIR environment variable.

- fix a strange effect in that sometimes tools ask to receive
  a package url with a "#md5=..." arriving at the server side.
  We now strip that part out before trying to serve the file.

- on startup don't create any initial indexes other 
  than the "root/pypi" pypi caching mirror.

- introduce ``--start``, ``--stop`` and ``--log`` commands for
  controling a background devpi-server run. (these commands
  previously were implemented with the devpi-client and the "server"
  sub command)

- fix issue27: provide full list of pypi names in root/pypi's simple
  view (and simple pages from inheriting indices)

- default to "eventlet" server when creating deployment with --gendeploy

- fix issue25: return 403 Forbidden when trying to delete the root user.

- fix name mangling issue for pypi-cache: "project_name*" is now matched
  correctly when a lookup for "project-name" happens.

- fix issue22: don't bypass CDN by default, rather provide an
  "--bypass-cdn" option to do it (in case you have cache-invalidation troubles)

- fix issue20 and fix issue23: normalize index specs internally ("/root/dev" ->
  "root/dev") and check if base indices exist.

- add Jenkins build job triggering for running the tests for a package
  through tox.

- inheritance cleanup: inherited versions for a project are now shadowed
  and not shown anymore with get_releaselinks() or in +simple pages
  if the "basename" is exactly shadowed.

- fix issue16: enrich projectconfig json with a "+shadow" file which
  lists shadowed "versions"

- initial wheel support: accept "whl" uploads and support caching 
  of whl files from pypi.python.org

- implemented internal push operation between devpi indexes

- show "docs" link if documentation has been uploaded

- pushing releases to pypi.python.org will now correctly 
  report the filetype/pyversion in the metadata.

- add setting of acl_upload for indexes.   Only the owning
  user and acl_upload users may upload releases, files 
  or documentation to an index.

- add --passwd USER option for setting a user's password server-side

- don't require email setting for creating users

devpi-client:

- removed ``server`` subcommand and options for controling background devpi-server
  processes to become options of ``devpi-server`` itself.

- fix issue14: lookup "python" from PATH for upload/packaging activities instead of
  using "sys.executable" which comes from the interpreter executing the "devpi" script.
  This allows to alias "devpi" to come from a virtualenv which is separate from
  the one used to perform packaging.

- fix issue35: "devpi index" cleanly errors out if no index is
  specified or in use.

- remember authentication on a per-root basis and cleanup "devpi use"
  interactions.  This makes switching between multiple devpi instances
  more seemless.

- fix issue17: better reporting when "devpi use" does not operate on valid URL

- test result upload and access: 
  "devpi test" invokes "tox --result-json ..." and uploads the test 
  result log to devpi-server.  
  "devpi list [-f] PKG" shows test result information.

- add "uploadtrigger_jenkins" configuration option through "devpi
  index".

- fix issue19: devpi use now memorizes --venv setting properly. Thanks Laurent.

- fix issue16: show files from shadowed versions 

- initial wheel support: "devpi upload --format=bdist_wheel" now uploads
  a wheel format file to the index.  (XXX "devpi install" will trigger
  pip commands with option "--use-wheels".)

- fix issue15: docs will now be built via "setup.py build_sphinx" 
  using a internal build dir so that the upload succeeds if conf.py
  would otherwise specify a non-standard location.

- implement and refine "devpi push" command.  It now accepts
  two forms "user/name" for specifying an internal devpi index
  and "pypi:REPONAME" for specifying a repository which must be
  defined in a .pypirc file.
  
- remove spurious pdb.set_trace() in devpi install command when
  no pip can be found.

- show and allow to set "acl_upload" for uploading priviliges

- add longer descriptions to each sub command, shown with
  "devpi COMMAND -h".

- removed pytestplugin support for now (pytest reporting directly to
  devpi-server)


0.9.4
----------------------------

server: 

- fix issue where lookups into subpages of the simple index
  (simple/NAME/VER) would not trigger a 404 as they should.

client:

- fix uploading by adding setup.py's dir to sys.path:  setup.py 
  files that import modules/packages for obtaining versions etc.
  now work. Thanks jbasko.

- fix automatic devpi-server startup on python26/windows 


0.9.3
----------------------------

server:

- fixed issue9: caching of packages where upstream provides no
  last-modified header now works.

- fixed issue8: only http/https archives are allowed and other
  schemes (such as ftp) are silently skipped

- added support for REST DELETE methods of projects and versions on an index

- added "argcomplete" support for tab completion on options
  (thanks to Anthon van der Neut)

client:

- new "devpi list" command to show projects of the in-use index or all
  release files of a project with "devpi list PROJECTNAME".

- new "devpi remove" command to remove releases from the current index,
  including any contained release files

- added "argcomplete" support for tab completion on options
  (thanks to Anthon van der Neut)


0.9.2 (compared to 0.9.1)
----------------------------

server:

- fix /USER/INDEXNAME root views to contain only latest in-stage packages

- make +api calls return bases so that "devpi use" can show them

client:

- introduce "devpi upload --fromdir" for uploading archives in bulk
  mode, thanks to Anthon van der Neut for helping with this!  (resolved issue5)

- improve automatic server handling via "devpi use"

- for "devpi server" you now need to specify "--log" to see log lines

- make "devpi use" also show base indexes by default

- fix issue4: auto-server data stored in non-dot dir


0.9.1 (compared to 0.9.0)
----------------------------

server:

- return 404 for submits to root/pypi

- properly sorted release file links on stage indexes

- "push" method on indexes for transfering release files to another
  pypi index

- properly handle urls from indexes with ~ and other special chars

- fix root/pypi and root/dev page serving in various cases

client:

- refined "python setup.py" calls from ``devpi upload`` with proper
  ``__file__`` attributes.  Thanks Andi Albrecht.

- implemented new "devpi push" command for pushing out releases

- improved error handling for devpi upload

- fix logoff if not logged in

- don't use --force-reinstall when using pip
