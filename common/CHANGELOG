3.2.1 (2018-01-18)
==================

Bug Fixes
---------

- fix issue496: PyPy 5.10 wheel upload failed because the version in the
  filename is longer again, the check for it is now removed, because it's
  pointless.


3.2.0 (2017-11-23)
==================

No significant changes.


3.2.0rc1 (2017-09-08)
=====================

Bug Fixes
---------

- fix issue343: enhanced ``splitbasename`` to split the name and version
  correctly in more cases.

- fix for url decoding issue with mirrors. When package filenames contain
  characters such as `!` or `+`, these get URL encoded to `%21` and `%2B` in
  the remote simple index. This fix ensures that in the filename saved to the
  disk cache these are decoded back to `!` or `+`.

==================

- add ``username``, ``password``, ``hostname`` and ``port`` properties to
  URL objects
