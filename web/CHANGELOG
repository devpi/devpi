Deprecations and Removals
-------------------------

- The ``--recreate-search-index`` option was replaced with the ``devpi-clear-search-index`` command.

- Dropped support for Python 2.7.


Features
--------

- project.pt: implement #319 - add link to latest version and summary of latest version to project view

- doc.pt: implement #339: when viewing older documentation, show link to latest and stable documentation.

- implement #346: add support for 'latest' and 'stable' versions for project version URLs

- version.pt, style.css: implement #347 - show navigation link when newer version is available

- status.pt: Fix #500 - the outside url in ``+status`` is now clickable.

- Fix 564: set response headers to not cache anything for "latest" and "stable" documentation URLs.

- index.pt, toxresult.pt, version.pt, style.css: Fix #632 - show warning symbol when no tests were run in tox results.

- The search indexing is now performed in a separate thread. Indexing prioritizes private indexes, then projects downloaded from mirrors and lastly never downloaded projects from mirrors.

- On server start a refresh run for the search index is started automatically. In addition to that the indexing is done in smaller batches, which allows resuming of indexing the large pypi project lists.

- In many cases re-indexing is now avoided.

- The master url in the ``+status`` view is now clickable.

- Add new ``--documentation-path`` option to set the path where documentation is unzipped to.

- version.pt, common.js: all list like metadata is now collapsed to ~3 lines instead of only classifiers.

- The ``--recreate-search-index`` option now just removes the whole index. Upon server restart the index is rebuilt automatically in the background.

- Indexing of mirrors will not trigger a refresh of the simple links for projects which have downloaded releases. This allows quicker indexing for new replicas and in case the search index is rebuilt using ``--recreate-search-index``.

- root.pt: added new view for user

- The path for Whoosh index files can now be specified as an option like this: ``--indexer-backend whoosh:path=/...``

- Indexer backend options can now be specified as a dict in yaml config files.


Bug Fixes
---------

- Fix #567: the ``pip search`` view is no longer proxied to the master.

- Pass query string on to documentation iframe, this fixes Sphinx search among other things.


Other Changes
-------------

- macros.pt, version.pt, style.css: moved separators to css.

- The minimum supported version of devpi-server is now 5.2.0.

- The interface of ``update_projects`` for search indexers has changed. The list of projects is now a list of ``ProjectIndexingInfo`` objects instead of ``dict``. To get the dictionary as before, call ``preprocess_project`` on the object.


3.5.2 (2019-06-28)
==================

Bug Fixes
---------

- iterate over mirror projects instead of building full list for indexing.


3.5.1 (2019-04-26)
==================

Bug Fixes
---------

- when mirror names are indexed a full reindex was triggered, now only the project names of the mirror are indexed.

- require --offline mode when using --recreate-search-index option. Otherwise reindexing may hang when trying to index a mirror.


3.5.0 (2018-11-16)
==================

Features
--------

- feature #193: adding support for using markdown in package descriptions.


Bug Fixes

Bug Fixes
---------

- Fix rendering of empty description which caused a traceback on Python 2.7.


3.4.0 (2018-09-08)
==================

Features
--------

- implement #503: the package description is rendered on demand instead of by event handling.

- implement #504: the documentation is unpacked and cached on demand instead of relying on event processing.

- Add possibility for plugins to implement search backends as replacement for the default whoosh based backend.


3.3.0 (2018-05-04)
==================

Features
--------

- add ``devpiserver_on_remove_file`` hook implementation to handle removal of
  unpacked documentation. Thanks to Dr Colin Kong for the PR.

- Use ``mirror_web_url_fmt`` in ``get_description`` for mirror indexes.

---------

- fix #487: rewrite internal links in order to update browser history/URL

- fix #494: fix redirect for +simple pages after PEP 503 fixes in devpi-server.

---------

- fix issue482: let external links in documentation open outside of iframe.

- Prevent stale static resources from browser caching by adding devpi-web
  version to their URLs.


3.2.1 (2017-11-23)
==================

No significant changes.


3.2.1rc1 (2017-09-08)
=====================

Bug Fixes
---------

- make search results compatible with pip showing INSTALLED/LATEST info.

- fix server error by returning 404 when a toxresult can't be found.


3.2.0 (2017-04-23)
==================

- version.pt: add "No releases" when there are none.

- project.pt: add "Documentation" column with link to documentation per version.


3.1.1 (2016-07-15)
==================

- removed unnecessary fetching of mirror data during indexing.


3.1.0 (2016-04-22)
==================

- use readme-renderer like PyPI does.

- if rendering the description causes errors, they are appended at the end.

- When creating the preview snippet for search results on documentation and the
  extracted doc files can't be accessed, then the preview will contain error
  information instead of raising an internal server error. See issue324

- fix issue335: The documentation wasn't linked for projects with
  non-normalized names.

- fix issue324: The project name wasn't correctly normalized when trying to
  access unpacked documentation in some code paths.

- all generated URLs in devpi-web are now normalized and don't go through a
  redirect anymore.

- added some internal infos to view data for use in theme templates. Any view
  data starting with an underscore is internal and may change between releases
  without notice. see issue319


3.0.0 (2016-02-12)
==================

- dropped support for python2.6

- index.pt, root.pt, style.css: added title and description to
  users and indexes.

- root.pt, style.css: more compact styling of user/index overview using
  flexbox, resulting in three columns at most sizes

- cleanup previously unpacked documentation to remove obsolete files.

- store hash of doczip with the unpacked data to avoid unpacking if the data
  already exists.

- project.pt, version.pt: renamed ``pypi_whitelist`` related things to
  ``mirror_whitelist``.

- require and adapt to devpi-server-3.0.0 which always uses
  normalized project names internally and offers new hooks.
  devpi-web-3.0.0 is incompatible to devpi-server-2.X.

- doc.pt, macros.pt, style.css, docview.js: use scrollbar of documentation
  iframe, so documentation that contains dynamically resizing elements works
  correctly. For that to work, the search from and navigation was moved into a
  wrapping div with class ``header``, so it can overlap the top of the iframe.


2.6.0 (2016-01-29)
==================

- fix issue305: read documentation html files in binary and let BeautifulSoup
                detect the encoding.

- require devpi-server >= 2.6.0

- support for ``pip search`` command on indexes


2.5.0 (2015-11-19)
==================

- fix issue288: classifiers rendering wrong with read only data views

- index.pt, project.pt, version.pt: added info about pypi_whitelist. This
  requires devpi-server > 2.4.0 to work.

- fix issue286: indexing of most data failed due to new read only views


2.4.2 (2015-11-11)
==================

- log exceptions during search index updates.

- adapted tests/code to work with devpi-server-2.4


2.4.1 (2015-10-09)
==================

- fix issue255: close and discard whoosh searchers after each use, they use too
  much memory if stored in a thread local for reuse.


2.4.0 (2015-07-09)
==================

- macros.pt: Add autofocus attribute to search field

- macros.pt and style.css: Moved "How to search?" to the right of the search
  button and adjusted width of search field accordingly.

- fix issue244: server status info

  - added support for status message plugin hook ``devpiweb_get_status_info``
  - macros.pt: added macros ``status`` and ``statusbadge`` and placed them
    below the search field.
  - added status.pt: shows server status information

- toxresults.pt: fix missing closing ``div`` tag.


2.3.0 (2015-05-13)
==================

- toxresults.pt: use just one line for result status indicator

- adapt devpi-web to devpi-server-2.2.0 hash-spec changes

- version.pt: moved hash to title attribute of table cell. With the upcoming
  change to sha256 it's too long and it's available from the link url as well.

- use renamed devpiserver_run_commands hook 

- fix issue233: projects on root/pypi with no releases lead to a traceback


2.2.3 (2015-02-24)
==================

- fix issue207: added documentation url for latest stable release of a package.

==================

- fix issue184: better height calculation of documentation iframe.


2.2.1
=====

- require devpi-server>=2.1.2

- fix issue175: use normalized name of projects, so redirects from unnormalized
