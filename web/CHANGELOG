3.1.1 (2016-07-15)
------------------

- removed unnecessary fetching of mirror data during indexing.


3.1.0 (2016-04-22)
------------------

- use readme-renderer like PyPI does.

- if rendering the description causes errors, they are appended at the end.

- When creating the preview snippet for search results on documentation and the
  extracted doc files can't be accessed, then the preview will contain error
  information instead of raising an internal server error. See issue324

- fix issue335: The documentation wasn't linked for projects with
  non-normalized names.

- fix issue324: The project name wasn't correctly normalized when trying to
  access unpacked documentation in some code paths.

- all generated URLs in devpi-web are now normalized and don't go through a
  redirect anymore.

- added some internal infos to view data for use in theme templates. Any view
  data starting with an underscore is internal and may change between releases
  without notice. see issue319


3.0.0 (2016-02-12)
------------------

- dropped support for python2.6

- index.pt, root.pt, style.css: added title and description to
  users and indexes.

- root.pt, style.css: more compact styling of user/index overview using
  flexbox, resulting in three columns at most sizes

- cleanup previously unpacked documentation to remove obsolete files.

- store hash of doczip with the unpacked data to avoid unpacking if the data
  already exists.

- project.pt, version.pt: renamed ``pypi_whitelist`` related things to
  ``mirror_whitelist``.

- require and adapt to devpi-server-3.0.0 which always uses
  normalized project names internally and offers new hooks.
  devpi-web-3.0.0 is incompatible to devpi-server-2.X.

- doc.pt, macros.pt, style.css, docview.js: use scrollbar of documentation
  iframe, so documentation that contains dynamically resizing elements works
  correctly. For that to work, the search from and navigation was moved into a
  wrapping div with class ``header``, so it can overlap the top of the iframe.


2.6.0 (2016-01-29)
------------------

- fix issue305: read documentation html files in binary and let BeautifulSoup
                detect the encoding.

- require devpi-server >= 2.6.0

- support for ``pip search`` command on indexes


2.5.0 (2015-11-19)
------------------

- fix issue288: classifiers rendering wrong with read only data views

- index.pt, project.pt, version.pt: added info about pypi_whitelist. This
  requires devpi-server > 2.4.0 to work.

- fix issue286: indexing of most data failed due to new read only views


2.4.2 (2015-11-11)
------------------

- log exceptions during search index updates.

- adapted tests/code to work with devpi-server-2.4


2.4.1 (2015-10-09)
------------------

- fix issue255: close and discard whoosh searchers after each use, they use too
  much memory if stored in a thread local for reuse.


2.4.0 (2015-07-09)
------------------

- macros.pt: Add autofocus attribute to search field

- macros.pt and style.css: Moved "How to search?" to the right of the search
  button and adjusted width of search field accordingly.

- fix issue244: server status info

  - added support for status message plugin hook ``devpiweb_get_status_info``
  - macros.pt: added macros ``status`` and ``statusbadge`` and placed them
    below the search field.
  - added status.pt: shows server status information

- toxresults.pt: fix missing closing ``div`` tag.


2.3.0 (2015-05-13)
------------------

- toxresults.pt: use just one line for result status indicator

- adapt devpi-web to devpi-server-2.2.0 hash-spec changes

- version.pt: moved hash to title attribute of table cell. With the upcoming
  change to sha256 it's too long and it's available from the link url as well.

- use renamed devpiserver_run_commands hook 

- fix issue233: projects on root/pypi with no releases lead to a traceback


2.2.3 (2015-02-24)
------------------

- fix issue207: added documentation url for latest stable release of a package.


2.2.2 (2014-11-27)
------------------

- fix issue184: better height calculation of documentation iframe.


2.2.1
---------------

- require devpi-server>=2.1.2

- fix issue175: use normalized name of projects, so redirects from unnormalized
  names works.  NOTE that if you had issues with documentation uploads
  not appearing because of normalization issues ("-" or "_" appearing 
  in the name for example) you need to re-upload the docs or 
  do a full export/import cycle.  

- fix view when tox results can not be parsed. 

- version.pt: removed "code" tag around overwrite count.

- macros.pt: added "footer" tag around the whole footer part.

- version.pt: moved file type, python version and size info from their own
  columns into the file column.

- version.pt: moved history column from before the tox results column to behind
  the tox results.

- version.pt: removed "last modified" from history column

- version.pt: removed timestamp from "replaced" action in history column

- version.pt: add link to PyPI page if applicable.

- fix project page view if there are downloads with filenames which can't be
  parsed as packages with version number

- fix notfound-redirect when serving under an outside URL with a sub path



2.2.0
---------------

- require devpi-server >= 2.1.0

- static resources now have a plus in front to avoid clashes with usernames and
  be consistent with how other urls work: "+static/..." and "+theme-static/..."

- adjusted font-sizes and cut-off width of content.

- only show underline on links when hovering.

- make the "description hasn't been rendered" warning stand out.

- version.pt: moved md5 sum from it's own column to the file column below the
  download link

- version.pt: added "history" column showing last modified time and infos
  about uploads and pushes.

- fix issue153: friendly error messages on upstream errors.

- index.pt: show permissions on index page

- allow overwriting of templates for theming.

- show version info for currently active packages/plugins.

- fix encoding issue when loading long description with Python 3.4 on Windows.

- requires devpi-server 2.0.6.


2.0.1
---------------

- fix issue125: javascript for embedded doc view didn't work correctly.

- fix issue118: rendering of description with unicode.


2.0.0
---------------

- initial release

- fix issue112 (reported on devpi-server): introduce a URL for showing
  docs using ``latest`` instead of a version.  This will dynamically
  resolve to the latest version.
