1.X
----------------

- fix normalization import/export issue: pypi names take precendence
  for defining the "real" name of a project.

- use types/url/metadata/validation functionality of new depdency devpi_common 

- internal cleanup using pytest-flakes

1.1
----------------

- systematically test pypi/mirror code against all 34K pypi projects
  so that we know that all http/https installable archive links that pypi offers 
  are correctly recognized by devpi-server's root/pypi index.

- if no pypi mirror state is known, devpi-server now calls
  pypi to obtain names/serials.  It will fail to start
  if no such initial connection is possible.  Once a first mirror
  state is known, subsequent devpi-server starts will
  not perform this initial query.

- speed up and make more reliable all operations on private packages which
  have no pypi.python.org release: we can now determine if a project
  exists on pypi and under which name exactly without
  remote queries or redirects to pypi.python.org.

- fix issue45: register/upload package names are now properly 
  validated and redirects take place if e.g. a project was
  registered as "name-sub" and "+simple/name_sub" is queried.

- new --upgrade-state command to allow for easy and safe
  in-place upgrading of server state.  This is not guranteed
  to be possible for all future releases which might require
  using --export with an older version and --import with a newer
  version.

- new --export/--import options to dump and import server contents:
  users, indexes, docs, release files and (test) attachments.
  Note that root/pypi (PyPI-caching information) will not be exported/imported.
  (maybe in the future if there is demand). 

- fix issue49: both push and import/export now support docfiles.  Note,
  however, that docfiles relate to a project as a whole and are not tied
  to a particular version.  This property is inherited from the PyPI
  standard upload_docs action and cannot be changed without interfering
  or replacing the upload_docs protocol of setuptools/sphinx.

- fix issue51: return 200 code if release file is successfully uploaded 
  but jenkins could not be triggered (previously returned 500)

- reject simple/NAME if NAME contains non-ascii characters
  (PEP426 naming rules)

- devpi-server now returns a X-DEVPI-API-VERSION and
  X-DEVPI-SERVER-VERSION header.  For future incompatible changes 
  these versions allow clients to reject interactions.

- also add ".serverversion" file and write it if it does not
  exist, and make devpi-server use it to verify if
  operating on a compatible server data layout, otherwise bail out.

- address issue43: --gendeploy now uses pip without --pre and
  explicitely instructs pip to install the exact same version 
  of devpi-server with which --gendeploy is issued.

- fix issue46 -- for GET /root/pypi/ only show a link to the
  simple page instead of computing "latest in-stage packages"
  which is only useful for devpi's user indices.

- fix issue37: upload with expired login causes proper 401


1.0
----------------

- rename "--datadir" to "serverdir" to better match
  the also picked up DEVPI_SERVERDIR environment variable.

- fix a strange effect in that sometimes tools ask to receive
  a package url with a "#md5=..." arriving at the server side.
  We now strip that part out before trying to serve the file.

- on startup don't create any initial indexes other 
  than the "root/pypi" pypi caching mirror.

- introduce ``--start``, ``--stop`` and ``--log`` commands for
  controling a background devpi-server run. (these commands
  previously were implemented with the devpi-client and the "server"
  sub command)

- fix issue27: provide full list of pypi names in root/pypi's simple
  view (and simple pages from inheriting indices)

- default to "eventlet" server when creating deployment with --gendeploy

- fix issue25: return 403 Forbidden when trying to delete the root user.

- fix name mangling issue for pypi-cache: "project_name*" is now matched
  correctly when a lookup for "project-name" happens.

- fix issue22: don't bypass CDN by default, rather provide an
  "--bypass-cdn" option to do it (in case you have cache-invalidation troubles)

- fix issue20 and fix issue23: normalize index specs internally ("/root/dev" ->
  "root/dev") and check if base indices exist.

- add Jenkins build job triggering for running the tests for a package
  through tox.

- inheritance cleanup: inherited versions for a project are now shadowed
  and not shown anymore with getreleaselinks() or in +simple pages
  if the "basename" is exactly shadowed.

- fix issue16: enrich projectconfig json with a "+shadow" file which
  lists shadowed "versions"

- initial wheel support: accept "whl" uploads and support caching 
  of whl files from pypi.python.org

- implemented internal push operation between devpi indexes

- show "docs" link if documentation has been uploaded

- pushing releases to pypi.python.org will now correctly 
  report the filetype/pyversion in the metadata.

- add setting of acl_upload for indexes.   Only the owning
  user and acl_upload users may upload releases, files 
  or documentation to an index.

- add --passwd USER option for setting a user's password server-side

- don't require email setting for creating users

0.9.4
----------------

- fix issue where lookups into subpages of the simple index
  (simple/NAME/VER) would not trigger a 404 as they should.

0.9.3
----------------

- fixed issue9: caching of packages where upstream provides no
  last-modified header now works.

- fixed issue8: only http/https archives are allowed and other
  schemes (such as ftp) are silently skipped

- added support for REST DELETE methods of projects and versions on an index

- added "argcomplete" support for tab completion on options
  (thanks to Anthon van der Neut)

0.9.2
----------------

- fix /USER/INDEXNAME root views to contain only latest in-stage packages

- make +api calls return bases so that "devpi use" can show them

0.9.1
----------------

- return 404 for submits to root/pypi

- properly sorted release file links on stage indexes

- "push" method on indexes for transfering release files to another
  pypi index

- properly handle urls from indexes with ~ and other special chars

- fix root/pypi and root/dev page serving in various cases

0.9.0
----------------

- implement more precise pypi.python.org CDN/caching invalidation
  technique, using the most recent PyPI API ("X-PYPI-LAST-SERIAL" 
  on simple pages and xmlrpc.list_packages_with_serial()).
  also simplify background tasks to become only one async 
  task doing both changelog checking and triggering updates.

- use a filesystem based storage mechanism instead of Redis

- prevent automatic decoding of gzip files in case of content encoding

- XXX preliminarily introduce new int/dev, int/prod indexes where int/dev 
  inherits packages from both int/prod and ext/pypi.  

- XXX introduce preliminary support for client-side "devpi" workflow tool

- allow uploads to int/dev

- if no crontab exists for a user, simply create one
  instead of erroring out.  Thanks Andi Albrecht.

- internal refactoring for better organisation of redis access


0.8.5
----------------

- re-fix issue6: tests and fixes for django-debug-toolbar
  where recursive scraping was accidentally triggered

- remove fine-grained http caching for now because caching 
  on the index level seems enough.  This avoids an issues that
  occured when installing icalendar and also some offline/online
  state change issues.  

- added a note to README for how to upgrade --gendeploy installs

- remove general dependency on virtualenv which 
  is only needed for --gendeploy.  Adapt docs accordingly.

- remove dependency on pip by shifting the relevant 
  scraping bits directly to _pip.py

0.8.4
----------------

- use pip's link parser rather than beautifulsoup
  to benefit from link parsing code tested out 
  and maintained in the wild.  Adapt README.

- skip a test if crontab command is not present

  (thanks Markus Zapke-Gruendemann)

- release 0.8.3 is not useable

0.8.2
------------------------------

- fix issue6 - some edge cases for link parsing uncovered
  by BeautifulSoup and CouchApp installs. Thanks Anton Baklanov.

- fix issue5 - require minimal versions for deps, thanks Andi Albrecht

- remove superflous include lines in MANIFEST.in


0.8.1
------------------------------

- fix: change gendeployed supervisord.conf  to not autostart
  processes on "devpi-ctl" invocations.  "devpi-ctl help"
  would autostart the processes after a shutdown which is
  not very intuitive.  This is actually compatible with the 
  documentation.

- refactor --gendeploy related code to be in gendeploy.py

- fix: fixate path of devpi-server in gendeployed configuration
  to point to the freshly installed devpi-server. also add
  a note to the README.

0.8
------------------------------

- introduce "--gendeploy=TARGETDIR" for generating a virtualenv
  directory with supervisor-based configuration in TARGETDIR/etc
  and a TARGETDIR/bin/devpi-ctl helper to control the running
  of devpi-server and redis-server processes.

- fix issue4: keep the "changelog" thread active across
  network/reachability errors.  Thanks Laurent Brack.

- use argparse instead of optparse, simplify and group options

- fix python2.6 and simplify logging configuration

0.7

-  Initial release
