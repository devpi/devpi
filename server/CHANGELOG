0.9.3.dev
----------------

- fixed issue9: caching of packages where upstream provides no
  last-modified header now works.

0.9.2
----------------

- fix /USER/INDEXNAME root views to contain only latest in-stage packages

- make +api calls return bases so that "devpi use" can show them

0.9.1
----------------

- return 404 for submits to root/pypi

- properly sorted release file links on stage indexes

- "push" method on indexes for transfering release files to another
  pypi index

- properly handle urls from indexes with ~ and other special chars

- fix root/pypi and root/dev page serving in various cases

0.9.0
----------------

- implement more precise pypi.python.org CDN/caching invalidation
  technique, using the most recent PyPI API ("X-PYPI-LAST-SERIAL" 
  on simple pages and xmlrpc.list_packages_with_serial()).
  also simplify background tasks to become only one async 
  task doing both changelog checking and triggering updates.

- use a filesystem based storage mechanism instead of Redis

- prevent automatic decoding of gzip files in case of content encoding

- XXX preliminarily introduce new int/dev, int/prod indexes where int/dev 
  inherits packages from both int/prod and ext/pypi.  

- XXX introduce preliminary support for client-side "devpi" workflow tool

- allow uploads to int/dev

- if no crontab exists for a user, simply create one
  instead of erroring out.  Thanks Andi Albrecht.

- internal refactoring for better organisation of redis access


0.8.5
----------------

- re-fix issue6: tests and fixes for django-debug-toolbar
  where recursive scraping was accidentally triggered

- remove fine-grained http caching for now because caching 
  on the index level seems enough.  This avoids an issues that
  occured when installing icalendar and also some offline/online
  state change issues.  

- added a note to README for how to upgrade --gendeploy installs

- remove general dependency on virtualenv which 
  is only needed for --gendeploy.  Adapt docs accordingly.

- remove dependency on pip by shifting the relevant 
  scraping bits directly to _pip.py

0.8.4
----------------

- use pip's link parser rather than beautifulsoup
  to benefit from link parsing code tested out 
  and maintained in the wild.  Adapt README.

- skip a test if crontab command is not present

  (thanks Markus Zapke-Gruendemann)

- release 0.8.3 is not useable

0.8.2
------------------------------

- fix issue6 - some edge cases for link parsing uncovered
  by BeautifulSoup and CouchApp installs. Thanks Anton Baklanov.

- fix issue5 - require minimal versions for deps, thanks Andi Albrecht

- remove superflous include lines in MANIFEST.in


0.8.1
------------------------------

- fix: change gendeployed supervisord.conf  to not autostart
  processes on "devpi-ctl" invocations.  "devpi-ctl help"
  would autostart the processes after a shutdown which is
  not very intuitive.  This is actually compatible with the 
  documentation.

- refactor --gendeploy related code to be in gendeploy.py

- fix: fixate path of devpi-server in gendeployed configuration
  to point to the freshly installed devpi-server. also add
  a note to the README.

0.8
------------------------------

- introduce "--gendeploy=TARGETDIR" for generating a virtualenv
  directory with supervisor-based configuration in TARGETDIR/etc
  and a TARGETDIR/bin/devpi-ctl helper to control the running
  of devpi-server and redis-server processes.

- fix issue4: keep the "changelog" thread active across
  network/reachability errors.  Thanks Laurent Brack.

- use argparse instead of optparse, simplify and group options

- fix python2.6 and simplify logging configuration

0.7

-  Initial release
