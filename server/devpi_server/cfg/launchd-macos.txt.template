On macOS you can let devpi-server be run at startup via launchctl.

Place the example net.devpi.plist file in ~/Library/LaunchAgents/

Then use the following commands to initialize the service and start devpi-server:

  launchctl load -w ~/Library/LaunchAgents/net.devpi.plist
  launchctl start net.devpi.devpi-server

To stop devpi-server, use the following command:

  launchctl stop net.devpi.devpi-server

To prevent the service from being run at startup use:

  launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/devpi-server.plist
