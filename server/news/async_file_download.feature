Replicas download files asynchronously from the metadata and will do so with multiple parallel requests. This means the metadata will be in sync faster and downloads will process quicker. Missing files will be downloaded on demand if they haven't been fetched yet. The new ``--file-replication-threads`` option allows controlling the amount of parallel downloads. Event processing waits until files for that serial are available. Since newest files are downloaded first, event processing might wait until all files are downloaded.
