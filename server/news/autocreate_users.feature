Add ``--autocreate-users`` server option. Autocreates users that don't exist in devpi, but have successfully authenticated via an authentication plugin. A typical example of when to enable this would be when authenticating via an LDAP directory. Autocreated users have an invalidated password hash `*` to prevent local authentication. Includes a new ``devpiserver_user_created`` hook. A new hook which is called when a new user is created. This will come in handy for creating default indexes for autocreated users.
