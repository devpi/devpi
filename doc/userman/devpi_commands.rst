    Start a server which serves multiple users and indices. The special root/pypi
    index is a cached mirror of pypi.python.org and is created by default. All
    indices are suitable for pip or easy_install usage and setup.py upload ...
    invocations.
    
    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
    
    web serving options:
      --host HOST           domain/ip address to listen on. Use --host=0.0.0.0 if
                            you want to accept connections from anywhere.
                            [localhost]
      --port PORT           port to listen for http requests. [3141]
      --threads THREADS     number of threads to start for serving clients. [50]
      --outside-url URL     the outside URL where this server will be reachable.
                            Set this if you proxy devpi-server through a web
                            server and the web server does not set or you want to
                            override the custom X-outside-url header.
      --debug               run wsgi application with debug logging
      --profile-requests NUM
                            profile NUM requests and print out cumulative stats.
                            After print profiling is restarted. By default no
                            profiling is performed.
      --logger-cfg LOGGER_CFG
                            path to .json or .yaml logger configuration file,
                            requires at least python2.7. If you specify a yaml
                            file you need to have the pyyaml package installed.
      --theme THEME         folder with template and resource overwrites for the
                            web interface
    
    mirroring options:
      --mirror-cache-expiry SECS
                            (experimental) time after which projects in mirror
                            indexes are checked for new releases. [1800]
      --replica-max-retries NUM
                            Number of retry attempts for replica connection
                            failures (such as aborted connections to pypi).
      --offline-mode        (experimental) prevents connections to any upstream
                            server (e.g. pypi) and only serves locally cached
                            files through the simple index used by pip.
      --no-root-pypi        don't create root/pypi on server initialization.
    
    deployment and data options:
      --version             show devpi_version (4.4.0)
      --role {master,replica,standalone,auto}
                            set role of this instance. The default 'auto' sets
                            'standalone' by default and 'replica' if the --master-
                            url option is used. To enable the replication protocol
                            you have to explicitly set the 'master' role. [auto]
      --master-url MASTER_URL
                            run as a replica of the specified master server
      --replica-cert pem_file
                            when running as a replica, use the given .pem file as
                            the SSL client certificate to authenticate to the
                            server (EXPERIMENTAL)
      --gen-config          (unix only ) generate example config files for
                            nginx/supervisor/crontab/systemd, taking other passed
                            options into account (e.g. port, host, etc.)
      --secretfile path     file containing the server side secret used for user
                            validation. If it does not exist, a random secret is
                            generated on start up and used subsequently.
                            [{serverdir}/.secret]
      --requests-only       only start as a worker which handles read/write web
                            requests but does not run an event processing or
                            replication thread.
      --passwd USER         set password for user USER (interactive)
      --serverdir DIR       directory for server data. By default,
                            $DEVPI_SERVERDIR is used if it exists, otherwise the
                            default is '~/.devpi/server'
      --init                initialize devpi-server state in an empty directory
                            (also see --serverdir)
      --restrict-modify SPEC
                            specify which users/groups may create other users and
                            their indices. Multiple users and groups are separated
                            by commas. Groups need to be prefixed with a colon
                            like this: ':group'. By default anonymous users can
                            create users and then create indices themself, but not
                            modify other users and their indices. The root user
                            can do anything. When this option is set, only the
                            specified users/groups can create and modify users and
                            indices. You have to add root explicitely if wanted.
      --keyfs-cache-size NUM
                            size of keyfs cache. If your devpi-server installation
                            gets a lot of writes, then increasing this might
                            improve performance. Each entry uses 1kb of memory on
                            average. So by default about 10MB are used. [10000]
      --storage NAME        the storage backend to use. This choice will be stored
                            in your '--serverdir' upon initialization. "pg8000":
                            Postgresql backend, "sqlite": SQLite backend with
                            files on the filesystem, "sqlite_db_files": SQLite
                            backend with files in DB for testing only
    
    serverstate export / import options:
      --export PATH         export devpi-server database state into PATH. This
                            will export all users, indices, release files (except
                            for mirrors), test results and documentation.
      --hard-links          use hard links during export instead of copying files.
                            All limitations for hard links on your OS apply. USE
                            AT YOUR OWN RISK
      --import PATH         import devpi-server database from PATH where PATH is a
                            directory which was created by a 'devpi-server
                            --export PATH' operation, using the same or an earlier
                            devpi-server version. Note that you can only import
                            into a fresh server state directory (positional
                            argument to devpi-server).
      --no-events           no events will be run during import, instead they
                            arepostponed to run on server start. This allows much
                            faster start of the server after import, when devpi-
                            web is used. When you start the server after the
                            import, the search index and documentation will
                            gradually update until the server has caught up with
                            all events. [True]
    
    background server (DEPRECATED, see --gen-config to use a process manager from your OS):
      --start               start the background devpi-server
      --stop                stop the background devpi-server
      --status              show status of background devpi-server
      --log                 show logfile content of background server
    
    search indexing:
      --recreate-search-index
                            Recreate search index for all projects and their
                            documentation. This is only needed if there where
                            indexing related errors in a devpi-web release and you
                            want to upgrade only devpi-web without a full devpi-
                            server import/export.
