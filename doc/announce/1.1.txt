devpi-1.1: much improved PyPI mirroring, data migration
=========================================================                       
                 
The devpi-{server,client}-1.1 releases bring a lot of refinements
and improvements for serving standalone pypi mirrors or company/private
indexes which seemlessly merge in PyPI releases, mainly:

- improved speed and semantics of pypi cache.  devpi-server
  has been tested to correctly mirror all ~34000 projects
  on pypi.python.org now, and minimizes upstream interactions
  by fully exploiting the existing mirroring protocols.

- data migration: new --upgrade/import/export options.
  versioning of serverstate and API calls so that future
  changes can be detected by clients.

- better support for ".whl" files and many other little 
  improvements and bug fixes, see the changelog
  below for more info.

Note that devpi-1.1 will require to ``--upgrade`` your 1.0 
server state before you can serve with devpi-server-1.1 release.

Docs also were updated.  Here is a Quickstart tutorial 
for efficient pypi-mirroring on your laptop::    
                                                                                
    http://doc.devpi.net/1.1/quickstart-pypimirror.html                         
                                                                                
And if you want to manage your releases or implement staging                    
as an individual or within an organisation::                                    
                                                                                
    http://doc.devpi.net/1.1/quickstart-releaseprocess.html                     
                                                                                
If you want to permanently install devpi-server and potentially                 
access it from many clients::                                                   
                                                                                
    http://doc.devpi.net/1.1/quickstart-server.html                             
                                                                                
More documentation and the beginning of an exhaustive user manual::

CHANGELOG 1.1
----------------------------

devpi-server:

- systematically test pypi/mirror code against all 34K pypi projects
  so that we know that all http/https installable archive links that pypi offers 
  are correctly recognized by devpi-server's root/pypi index.

- if no pypi mirror state is known, devpi-server now calls
  pypi to obtain names/serials.  It will fail to start
  if no such initial connection is possible.  Once a first mirror
  state is known, subsequent devpi-server starts will
  not perform this initial query.

- speed up and make more reliable all operations on private packages which
  have no pypi.python.org release: we can now determine if a project
  exists on pypi and under which name exactly without
  remote queries or redirects to pypi.python.org.

- fix issue45: register/upload package names are now properly 
  validated and redirects take place if e.g. a project was
  registered as "name-sub" and "+simple/name_sub" is queried.

- new --upgrade-state command to allow for easy and safe
  in-place upgrading of server state.  This is not guranteed
  to be possible for all future releases which might require
  using --export with an older version and --import with a newer
  version.

- new --export/--import options to dump and import server contents:
  users, indexes, docs, release files and (test) attachments.
  Note that root/pypi (PyPI-caching information) will not be exported/imported.
  (maybe in the future if there is demand). 

- fix issue49: both push and import/export now support docfiles.  Note,
  however, that docfiles relate to a project as a whole and are not tied
  to a particular version.  This property is inherited from the PyPI
  standard upload_docs action and cannot be changed without interfering
  or replacing the upload_docs protocol of setuptools/sphinx.

- fix issue51: return 200 code if release file is successfully uploaded 
  but jenkins could not be triggered (previously returned 500)

- reject simple/NAME if NAME contains non-ascii characters
  (PEP426 naming rules)

- devpi-server now returns a X-DEVPI-API-VERSION and
  X-DEVPI-SERVER-VERSION header.  For future incompatible changes 
  these versions allow clients to reject interactions.

- also add ".serverversion" file and write it if it does not
  exist, and make devpi-server use it to verify if
  operating on a compatible server data layout, otherwise bail out.

- address issue43: --gendeploy now uses pip without --pre and
  explicitely instructs pip to install the exact same version 
  of devpi-server with which --gendeploy is issued.

- fix issue46 -- for GET /root/pypi/ only show a link to the
  simple page instead of computing "latest in-stage packages"
  which is only useful for devpi's user indices.

- fix issue37: upload with expired login causes proper 401


devpi-client:

- detect "X-DEVPI-API-VERSION" header and check for compatibility.
  devpi-client currently supports version "1" and warns if
  no version is known (defaulting to "1").

- getjson now prints http reply headers if "-v|--verbose" was supplied.

- fix issue52: add "--no-vcs" option to force "devpi upload" to not
  vcs-export files before executing build/upload

- fix issue50: introduce "--toxargs" to "devpi test" invocations in
  order to add arbitrary arguments to tox.

- fix issue43: set PIP_PRE environment variable when executing
  "devpi install ..." so that the behaviour between 
  pip < 1.4 and >= 1.4 is normalized to always install 
  development versions.

- fix issue47: set PIP_USE_WHEEL with "devpi install ..." so that
  it will automatically pick up wheel files if pip>1.4 is used.

- fix issue42: allow to set empty bases for an index, so that it doesn't
  inherit anything.

- fix issue44: "use -l" doesn't break when a user has no index

- devpi test now invokes tox in-process (by importing tox) rather than
  a subprocess.


1.0
----------------------------

devpi-server:

- rename "--datadir" to "--serverdir" to better match
  the also picked up DEVPI_SERVERDIR environment variable.

- fix a strange effect in that sometimes tools ask to receive
  a package url with a "#md5=..." arriving at the server side.
  We now strip that part out before trying to serve the file.

- on startup don't create any initial indexes other 
  than the "root/pypi" pypi caching mirror.

- introduce ``--start``, ``--stop`` and ``--log`` commands for
  controling a background devpi-server run. (these commands
  previously were implemented with the devpi-client and the "server"
  sub command)

- fix issue27: provide full list of pypi names in root/pypi's simple
  view (and simple pages from inheriting indices)

- default to "eventlet" server when creating deployment with --gendeploy

- fix issue25: return 403 Forbidden when trying to delete the root user.

- fix name mangling issue for pypi-cache: "project_name*" is now matched
  correctly when a lookup for "project-name" happens.

- fix issue22: don't bypass CDN by default, rather provide an
  "--bypass-cdn" option to do it (in case you have cache-invalidation troubles)

- fix issue20 and fix issue23: normalize index specs internally ("/root/dev" ->
  "root/dev") and check if base indices exist.

- add Jenkins build job triggering for running the tests for a package
  through tox.

- inheritance cleanup: inherited versions for a project are now shadowed
  and not shown anymore with getreleaselinks() or in +simple pages
  if the "basename" is exactly shadowed.

- fix issue16: enrich projectconfig json with a "+shadow" file which
  lists shadowed "versions"

- initial wheel support: accept "whl" uploads and support caching 
  of whl files from pypi.python.org

- implemented internal push operation between devpi indexes

- show "docs" link if documentation has been uploaded

- pushing releases to pypi.python.org will now correctly 
  report the filetype/pyversion in the metadata.

- add setting of acl_upload for indexes.   Only the owning
  user and acl_upload users may upload releases, files 
  or documentation to an index.

- add --passwd USER option for setting a user's password server-side

- don't require email setting for creating users

devpi-client:

- removed ``server`` subcommand and options for controling background devpi-server
  processes to become options of ``devpi-server`` itself.

- fix issue14: lookup "python" from PATH for upload/packaging activities instead of
  using "sys.executable" which comes from the interpreter executing the "devpi" script.
  This allows to alias "devpi" to come from a virtualenv which is separate from
  the one used to perform packaging.

- fix issue35: "devpi index" cleanly errors out if no index is
  specified or in use.

- remember authentication on a per-root basis and cleanup "devpi use"
  interactions.  This makes switching between multiple devpi instances
  more seemless.

- fix issue17: better reporting when "devpi use" does not operate on valid URL

- test result upload and access: 
  - "devpi test" invokes "tox --result-json ..." and uploads 
    the test result log to devpi-server.  
  - "devpi list [-f] PKG" shows test result information.

- add "uploadtrigger_jenkins" configuration option through "devpi
  index".

- fix issue19: devpi use now memorizes --venv setting properly. Thanks Laurent.

- fix issue16: show files from shadowed versions 

- initial wheel support: "devpi upload --format=bdist_wheel" now uploads
  a wheel format file to the index.  (XXX "devpi install" will trigger
  pip commands with option "--use-wheels".)

- fix issue15: docs will now be built via "setup.py build_sphinx" 
  using a internal build dir so that the upload succeeds if conf.py
  would otherwise specify a non-standard location.

- implement and refine "devpi push" command.  It now accepts
  two forms "user/name" for specifying an internal devpi index
  and "pypi:REPONAME" for specifying a repository which must be
  defined in a .pypirc file.
  
- remove spurious pdb.set_trace() in devpi install command when
  no pip can be found.

- show and allow to set "acl_upload" for uploading priviliges

- add longer descriptions to each sub command, shown with
  "devpi COMMAND -h".

- removed pytestplugin support for now (pytest reporting directly to
  devpi-server)

server: 

- fix issue where lookups into subpages of the simple index
  (simple/NAME/VER) would not trigger a 404 as they should.

- added "argcomplete" support for tab completion on options
  (thanks to Anthon van der Neut)

client:

- new "devpi list" command to show projects of the in-use index or all
  release files of a project with "devpi list PROJECTNAME".
