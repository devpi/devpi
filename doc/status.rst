Project status, roadmap and contact
----------------------------------------

Development background and road map
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Many devpi efforts were partly funded through commercial contracts
carried out by merlinux_ with Holger Krekel and Florian Schulze as lead
developers.  We aim to further the devpi system through further
contracts and payed support and to also collaborate with Donald Stufft
who is working on the warehouse_ and twine_ projects.

Known limitations
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

- devpi does not itself manage read-access: all information from a
  devpi-server can be read by whoever has access via http so it's up to
  the admins to implement proper per-organsation restrictions by
  configuring nginx_ or some other web service.

- Please checkout the `devpi issue tracker`_ for much further info.
