Project status, roadmap and contact
----------------------------------------

Development background and road map
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Many devpi efforts were partly funded through commercial contracts
carried out through pyfidelity UG (haftungsbeschr√§nkt) by Florian Schulze
and merlinux_ by Holger Krekel and Florian Schulze as lead
developers.  We aim to further the devpi system through further
contracts and paid support.

Known limitations
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

- devpi does not itself manage read-access: all information from a
  devpi-server can be read by whoever has access via http so it's up to
  the admins to implement proper per-organsation restrictions by
  configuring nginx_ or some other web service.

- Please checkout the `devpi issue tracker`_ for much further info.
