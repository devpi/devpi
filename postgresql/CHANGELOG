3.0.0 (2022-03-18)
==================


Deprecations and Removals
-------------------------

- Require at least devpi-server 6.2.0.


Features
--------

- Support performance and memory optimizations enabled by devpi-server >= 6.2.0.

- Support new storage interface from devpi-server 6.5.0 to keep files out of memory.

- Files are stored in a temporary location and committed to the database in one shorter transaction block. This also reduces the time locks are held on the database.

- Support memory optimizations enabled by devpi-server 6.5.0 to keep cache small.

- Switch to native interface introduced in pg8000 1.17.0.

- Stream files directly through database connection using ``COPY``.


Bug Fixes
---------

- Reduce chances of conflicts by using a postgresql sequence for serials. This can cause serials with no changes due to gaps in the sequence in case of conflicts, but these are harmless.


2.0.0 (2020-04-14)
==================

Deprecations and Removals
-------------------------

- Python 3.4 isn't supported anymore, Python 3.5 support will be dropped at its EOL in September 2020.


Features
--------

- Upgrade pg8000 to version 1.14.0 or newer and take advantage of its improved SSL interface.


1.1.0 (2020-01-31)
==================

Features
--------

- fix #738: add ``ssl_cert_reqs``, ``ssl_ca_certs``, ``ssl_certfile`` and ``ssl_keyfile`` settings to the --storage=pg8000 option. Each setting corresponds to the similarly-named key (remove the initial ``ssl_``) in the ``ssl`` parameter passed to pg8000.connect(). ``ssl_cert_reqs`` should be either "cert_optional" or "cert_required" and the other three settings are file names.


1.0.0 (2019-04-26)
==================

Deprecations and Removals
-------------------------

- Requires at least PostgreSQL 9.5 for ``ON CONFLICT`` support.

- Dropped support for Python 2.x and PyPy2.
